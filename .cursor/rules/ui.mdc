# UI Development Rules

## General Principles
- Do not modify UI elements (styles, layout, spacing) unless explicitly requested
- Always use Mantine components as the primary UI building blocks
- Avoid adding custom styles on top of Mantine components
  - Only add custom styles if:
    1. Explicitly requested by the user
    2. No suitable Mantine component/prop exists
  - When custom styling might be needed, ask for confirmation first
- Everytime we show a family member, use the component FamilyMember
- Everytime we show the gender, use GenderIcon

## Component Usage
- Default to Mantine components for all UI elements
- Use Mantine's built-in props and theme system for customization
- Consult with user before implementing custom CSS solutions
