# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements for both database and non-database aspects that could enhance the application's performance, functionality, and user experience.

## Database Improvements

### 1. Data Versioning System

#### What?

Create a comprehensive data versioning system to track changes to genealogical records over time.

#### Why?

Genealogical data often undergoes refinement as new information is discovered:

- Researchers may find conflicting information about dates, places, or relationships
- Sources and citations may be added to validate information
- Multiple competing theories may exist about family relationships
- Data quality can vary significantly between different sources

Without versioning, it's difficult to track the evolution of the family tree and compare different theories.

#### How?

Implement a robust versioning system using temporal tables.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Create a versioning schema to separate historical data:

   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA history;
   ```

2. Create history tables mirroring the main tables:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE history.individuals (
     id UUID NOT NULL,
     original_id UUID NOT NULL,
     gender PUBLIC.gender NOT NULL,
     gedcom_id BIGINT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     valid_from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
     valid_to TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
     change_reason TEXT
   );

   -- Create similar history tables for other entities
   ```

3. Create versioning triggers and functions for automatic history tracking
4. Implement functions for retrieving and comparing historical versions

### 2. Data Quality and Consistency Checks

#### What?

Create constraints and triggers to ensure data quality and consistency in genealogical records.

#### Why?

Genealogical data often has logical constraints that go beyond simple foreign keys:

- People can't be their own ancestors
- Birth dates should precede death dates
- Children should be born after their parents
- Marriage should occur when both spouses are alive
- Geographic consistency (e.g., events should occur in places that existed at that time)

#### How?

Implement custom constraints and triggers that enforce genealogical logic.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Create date validation constraints
2. Implement cyclic relationship prevention
3. Add parent-child age validation
4. Create geographic and temporal consistency checks

### 3. Denormalized Search Table

#### What?

Create a denormalized search table to improve full-text search across all entities.

#### Why?

- Need to search across multiple entity types simultaneously
- Complex search requirements for names, dates, and places
- Performance optimization for frequent searches
- Better handling of fuzzy matches and variations

#### How?

Create a dedicated search table with appropriate indexes and triggers.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Create a search configuration for genealogical terms
2. Implement the denormalized search table
3. Create triggers for automatic search table maintenance
4. Add full-text search capabilities

### 4. Database Partitioning

#### What?

Implement partitioning strategies for large tables to improve performance at scale.

#### Why?

As genealogical databases grow, performance can degrade:

- Large families can have thousands of individuals
- Historical records can span hundreds of years
- Tables like `individual_events` and `places` can grow very large

#### How?

Partition large tables by appropriate criteria.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Implement place partitioning by geographic region
2. Create time-based partitioning for events
3. Set up partition maintenance procedures

## Non-Database Improvements

### 1. API Performance Optimizations

#### What?

Optimize API endpoints to efficiently handle genealogical data retrieval patterns.

#### Why?

- Tree traversal requires multiple nested queries
- Relationship calculations involve complex path finding
- Family data often needs to be fetched in bulk
- Mobile clients may have bandwidth constraints

#### How?

Implement specialized API patterns and optimizations.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Implement GraphQL for flexible tree queries
2. Add batch APIs for efficient tree retrieval
3. Implement cursor-based pagination
4. Add sparse fieldsets support
5. Implement conditional requests with ETags

### 2. Application Caching Strategy

#### What?

Implement a comprehensive caching strategy to improve performance and reduce database load.

#### Why?

- Historical data rarely changes once entered correctly
- Family trees are frequently viewed by multiple users
- Common calculations are computationally expensive
- Research sessions involve repeated access to the same data

#### How?

Develop a multi-tiered caching strategy.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Implement Redis for caching complex structures
2. Add browser caching for static assets and data
3. Implement computed data caching
4. Create cache invalidation triggers
5. Set up tiered caching with different TTLs

### 3. Search Optimization & Algorithms

#### What?

Implement genealogy-specific search algorithms to improve match quality and relevance.

#### Why?

- Names have spelling variations across time and cultures
- Dates are often approximate or uncertain
- Places have changed names and boundaries historically
- Family relationships provide contextual relevance

#### How?

Implement specialized algorithms for genealogical data.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Add fuzzy name matching
2. Implement phonetic matching
3. Create date approximation matching
4. Add relationship path finding
5. Implement geographic proximity search

### 4. Data Import/Export Framework

#### What?

Create a robust framework for importing from and exporting to various genealogical data formats.

#### Why?

- Family trees are often shared between researchers
- Legacy data exists in older formats
- Data may need to be merged from multiple sources
- Users expect to be able to backup and transfer their data

#### How?

Develop a comprehensive import/export system with validation and conflict resolution.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Implement GEDCOM 7 support
2. Add FamilySearch API integration
3. Create batch processing for large imports
4. Implement conflict resolution system
5. Add export with selective filtering

### 5. Privacy & Access Control Model

#### What?

Implement a comprehensive privacy and access control system for genealogical data.

#### Why?

- Contains information about living individuals
- Has varying sensitivity levels
- May include data from private and public sources
- Different family members may have different privacy preferences

#### How?

Create a flexible, multi-level privacy and access control system.

#### Actionable Tasks

1. Implement tiered privacy levels
2. Create automatically enforced privacy rules
3. Add time-based privacy rules
4. Implement record-level access grants
5. Add privacy-aware data export

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing these improvements, consider the following approach:

1. Prioritize based on immediate user needs and technical debt
2. Implement changes incrementally to minimize disruption
3. Start with foundational improvements that enable other features
4. Validate changes with thorough testing, especially for data integrity
5. Document all changes and their impacts on the system

## Conclusion

These improvements represent a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing the application's functionality, performance, and user experience. While not all improvements need to be implemented immediately, they provide a clear direction for future development phases.

The improvements should be prioritized based on:

1. User impact and immediate needs
2. Technical dependencies between features
3. Resource availability
4. Risk assessment
5. Long-term maintainability

Each improvement can be implemented independently, allowing for an incremental approach that aligns with development resources and user feedback.
