# Improvements

This folder contains documentation about planned and potential improvements for various aspects of the Vata application. Each file focuses on specific areas of improvement, from high-level strategic changes to detailed technical optimizations.

## Files Overview

### Strategic Planning

- `future-improvements.md` - High-level strategic roadmap covering both database and non-database improvements. This is the main reference for understanding the overall improvement strategy.

### Technical Implementation Details

- `sql-schema-optimization.md` - Specific technical details about SQL schema improvements, including indexes, constraints, and data type optimizations.
- `data-fetching-standardization.md` - Implementation details for standardizing data fetching patterns, API functions, and React hooks.
- `typescript-type-standardization.md` - Guidelines for improving and standardizing TypeScript type definitions across the codebase.
- `react-component-optimization.md` - Best practices and improvements for React components and their performance.
- `function-duplication-and-utility-extraction.md` - Guidelines for reducing code duplication and creating reusable utility functions.

## File Organization

The files in this folder are organized in two categories:

1. **Strategic Planning** - High-level documents that outline the overall direction and major improvements (`future-improvements.md`)
2. **Technical Implementation** - Detailed documents that focus on specific technical areas and provide concrete implementation guidance

## How to Use These Documents

1. Reference specific technical documents when implementing improvements in their respective areas
2. Use these documents as guidelines rather than strict rules
3. Update the documents as new improvements are identified or implemented

## Contributing

When adding new improvement documentation:

1. Determine if it fits into an existing document or warrants a new one
2. Follow the established format:
   - What? - Clear description of the improvement
   - Why? - Justification and benefits
   - How? - Implementation approach
   - Actionable Tasks - Specific steps to implement
3. Update this README when adding new files
4. Keep improvements aligned with the project's goals and architecture

## Implementation Priority

When implementing improvements:

1. Focus on immediate user needs and technical debt first
2. Consider dependencies between different improvements
3. Balance effort vs. impact
4. Document progress and changes as improvements are implemented
